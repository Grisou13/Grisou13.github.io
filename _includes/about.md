# Who am I

I'm a developper, atleast right now.

I'm stuying in a swiss school, and hopefully will one day be able to get a major in computerscience.

## I'm from Switzerland

And it's awesome. But I truly want to get outside.

 - Flask
 - Python in general
 - Express.js
 - Some React.js

I haven't done it all, and want to do alot more:
 - Learn some Ruby
 - Learn some Rails
