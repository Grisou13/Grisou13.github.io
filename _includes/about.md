# Who am I

I'm a swiss developper, atleast right now.

I am now studying for a Technician degree in Web development.

It's a swiss paper, so maybe you haven't heard about it.
The gist is that I'm able to provide the work a bachelor can do, but without the math and computer science behind it.

I like developping stuff if I have free time. You can check some of it out on my (github)[https://github.com/Grisou13]

## I'm from Switzerland

And it's awesome!

But I haven't always been in switzerland, I have lived in Thailand with my family when I was a child.

I love travelling, and going out of the country. I do it as much as I can (and as much as my finances allow it).

# I know

Alot, but never enough. On the current list of most of the stuff I know and do:

 - Laravel
 - Flask
 - Python in general
 - Express.js
 - React.js
 - Android

I have touched, but form a far:

 - Angular
 - Ruby
 - Rails

I would like to:
 - Learn Java and Tomcat
 - Make a C++ library for searching. And make it work cross plateform
 - Create or tweak a small mini kernel (just for the fun of it)
